### Backlog Ordering Rationale
To efficiently order our backlog we started out with writing out a foundation of user stories that we believed accurately covered the primary functionality of the application, TradeTalk. Based on their similarities, the user stories were grouped into three main epics. The epics are user registration, stock search & display, and automatic buy and sell signal. The three epics were prioritized based on the logical ordering of how they will be delivered. We believe this backlog ordering rationale will help us develop the primary functionalities of TradeTalk and continue to add/change features with each iteration.

* Update - Once we completed our sprint on Jira, the backlog and kanban board for Sprint 1 were no longer available and Jira didn't allow access to backlogs and boards of previous sprints. However, the Roadmap shows the completed stories and tasks within each epic for Sprint 1.

### Kanban Board 
---
Our team used Kanban Board in Jira to assign, prioritize, and update tasks. It helped us to organize our work and focus on our workflow.

When the sprint 1 was completed, the Kanban Board was automatically cleared, so we recreated an image of the Kanban Board.

### Sprint Burndown Chart
---
The sprint burndown chart in Jira provided a graphic representation of the rate at which our tasks are completed and the amount of work that remains to be done. As we complete our story points, our chart slopes downward until there are 0 story points left on the last day of the sprint.

### Scrum Meetings
---

Daily scrum meetings helped us improve our communication and identify impediments early on and work to resolve it. Below is a recording of one of scrum meetings.

### Code Mobbing
---
By mobbing on our code, we improved communication and visibility within the team. It was also a great way to help eachother and resolve issues. Below is a video of the team mobbing on running the testing cases.

### Test Cases
---
As per the requirement, we included 10 unit tests in our test suite. Below is a screenshot showing that the tests pass.

### Sprint Review
---

To inspect the outcome of Sprint 1 and determine features for our next iteration, we held a Sprint Review at the end of Sprint 1. Below is a video of our sprint review.

### Sprint Forecast

Forecast: Our forecast for the work to be completed in Sprint 1 is 18 Story Points. This forecast contains a single epic, 
Building Out the User Profile Features, which consists of six individual stories, and their subtasks ranging from an 
estimated 2 story points up to 5 story points using the Fibonacci Scale.

Rationale: With no working history as a team, our velocity is zero, and we also have nothing to reference from prior 
sprints (Yesterdayâ€™s Weather), so we made a collaborative guess as a group. We also, in erring on the side of caution, 
chose what we believed to be a conservative number of story points for the work to be completed in Sprint 1. 
Additionally, as the backlog was groomed, we grouped stories based on their relationship to specific functions and/or 
features of the Outdoore Application to create four epics. We then took a logical look at the epics, assigning an order 
for completion based on what made sense (e.g. Building Out the User Profile Features before creating the In-app 
Messaging and User Matching).

And so, with this rationale, we concluded we would focus on Building Out the User Profile Features for Sprint 1. To 
help confirm this decision during our discussion, we identified the subtasks for each Story related to the user profile. 
Following this approach, if the group is able to complete the sprint work for the Building Out the User Stories epic 
early, we can decide, after meeting with the Product Owner, if additional stories will be pulled from the backlog to 
add into the sprint, Conversely, if the 18 story points turns out to be too much for the group to complete in Sprint 1, 
we can simply move the story or stories that are unable to be completed to the next sprint which will also help us to 
better estimate the number of story points to take on in the next sprint
