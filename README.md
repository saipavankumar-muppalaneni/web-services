## Product Backlog
---

### Backlog Ordering Rationale
To efficiently order our backlog we started out with writing out a foundation of user stories that we believed accurately covered the primary functionality of the application, TradeTalk. Based on their similarities, the user stories were grouped into three main epics. The epics are user registration, stock search & display, and automatic buy and sell signal. The three epics were prioritized based on the logical ordering of how they will be delivered. We believe this backlog ordering rationale will help us develop the primary functionalities of TradeTalk and continue to add/change features with each iteration.

* Update - Once we completed our sprint on Jira, the backlog and kanban board for Sprint 1 were no longer available and Jira didn't allow access to backlogs and boards of previous sprints. However, the Roadmap shows the completed stories and tasks within each epic for Sprint 1.

### Kanban Board 
---
Our team used Kanban Board in Jira to assign, prioritize, and update tasks. It helped us to organize our work and focus on our workflow.

When the sprint 1 was completed, the Kanban Board was automatically cleared, so we recreated an image of the Kanban Board.

### Sprint Burndown Chart
---
The sprint burndown chart in Jira provided a graphic representation of the rate at which our tasks are completed and the amount of work that remains to be done. As we complete our story points, our chart slopes downward until there are 0 story points left on the last day of the sprint.

### Scrum Meetings
---

Daily scrum meetings helped us improve our communication and identify impediments early on and work to resolve it. Below is a recording of one of scrum meetings.

### Code Mobbing
---
By mobbing on our code, we improved communication and visibility within the team. It was also a great way to help eachother and resolve issues. Below is a video of the team mobbing on running the testing cases.

### Sprint Review

To inspect the outcome of Sprint 1 and determine features for our next iteration, we held a Sprint Review at the end of Sprint 1. Below is a video of our sprint review.
